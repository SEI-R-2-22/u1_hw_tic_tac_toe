After watching numerous videos, this is the video that I found to explain it the best
and i had an actual understanding of how this person completed it.
I couldn't start this project by myself and certainly couldn't finish it with 
my knowledge and from things that I've learned in class, I know that my project is an almost
exact replica of his final version, however, I do feel that I am now a lot more comfortable in doing this task
and could see myself being able to do this in the near future (using similar code) 
with a little bit more practice, I know what I need to practice on and I plan on devoting 
a lot of time to catch up and get up to scratch with where I need to be-->
